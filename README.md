## ❓ Why Eat Word Exists

Existing vocabulary apps cluttered with generic word lists and prioritize obscure words over practical fluency. After months of learning terms I never used, I built Eat Word to merge contextual learning, active recall, and spaced repetition—letting you curate words from real life while AI automates retention. No more wasted effort. Just laser-focused, lifelong vocabulary growth.
